# BLE Sensor 1 - Parking Spot 1

## Setup Instructions

1. **Copy the code**: Copy the contents of `code.py` to your nRF52840 board's `code.py` file.

2. **Install required libraries**: 
   - Follow the guide: [Feather Sense CircuitPython Libraries](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-sense/feather-sense-circuitpython-libraries)
   - Copy these libraries to your board's `lib/` folder:
     - `adafruit_ble/`
     - `adafruit_apds9960.mpy`
     - `neopixel.mpy` (if not built-in)

3. **Configure**: This sensor is pre-configured for Parking Spot 1 with service UUID: `12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef0`

The code will run automatically once uploaded to your CircuitPython board.
